## Project Workflow 📊

### 1. Data Collection & Preparation
- Imported the **SA_Aqar dataset** containing property listings across major Saudi cities.  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats).  
- Standardized price and size columns for accurate comparisons.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Calculated **average property prices per city**.  
- Analyzed **distribution of property sizes** and number of bedrooms.  
- Explored **property features** (e.g., pool, elevator, central A/C).  
- Investigated the **correlation between property size and price**.  

### 3. Data Visualization
- Bar charts for **average property prices by city**.  
- Count plots for **bedrooms and features distribution**.  
- Scatter plots to show **size vs. price relationship**.  

### 4. City-Specific Analysis
- Each member analyzed one city in detail:
  - **Riyadh (Shaikha)**  
  - **Jeddah (Maitham)**  
  - **Khobar (Hashim)**

- Recommended the **best property** based on size, price, features, and location.  

### 5. Business Insights
